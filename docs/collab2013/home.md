## Welcome Party, Monday May 6!

Posted: 13 February 2013
Following up the success of the welcome party in Aachen last fall, we will host our own the Monday night before the meetings start. We don’t have any castles to show off, so we’ll be hanging out at the Great Dane Pub & Brewing Company. More details coming soon
