With the IPA Symposium, WIPAC revives the historic Telemark meetings on neutrino physics. The topics include neutrino astronomy and related multiwavelength messengers (cosmic rays, high-energy gamma rays, gravitational waves), neutrino properties (including accelerator-based experiments), and related cosmological and dark matter aspects of particle astrophysics. The format will follow that of the Madison Pheno meetings with morning plenary talks and afternoon parallel sessions.

## Confirmed plenary session talks include:
- Trevor Weekes, Overview and History of TeV Gamma-Ray Astronomy
- Giorgio Gratta, Overview of Double Beta-Decay Experiments
- Yvonne Wong, Cosmology and Neutrino Mass Constraints
- Jordon Goodman, Results from Milagro and Status of HAWC
- Nathan Whitehorn, Results from IceCube
- Jenny Thomas, Overview of Accelerator Neutrino Experiments
- Keith Bechtol, Results from Fermi
- GÃ¼nter Sigl, Origin and Acceleration of Cosmic Rays
- Paul Sommers, Ultrahigh-Energy Cosmic Rays
- Sarah Church, The Planck Mission
- Brian Humensky, CTA and the Future of High Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy
- Stefan Schoenert, Overview of Solar Neutrinos
- Tao Han, University of Pittsburgh
- Antonio Jesus Melgarejo Fernandez, Columbia University
- Lauren Hsu, Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics
