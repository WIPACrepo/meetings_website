The goal of this workshop is to discuss the origin of the galactic cosmic ray anisotropy focusing on the TeV energy range, and to address scenarios of their origin, acceleration and propagation in the interstellar medium and the effects of the nearby galactic environment. The discussion will include the analysis of the latest experimental results.

The workshop will be held at the Pyle Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, from October 28 to 29, 2011.

Topics of the workshop include:
- anisotropy and nearby supernova remnants and pulsars
- cosmic ray propagation through interstellar medium
- cosmic ray interaction with turbulent interstellar magnetic field
- cosmic ray interaction with heliosphere
- recent results on cosmic ray anisotropy as a function of energy and angular scale
- analysis techniques in cosmic ray anisotropy studies
