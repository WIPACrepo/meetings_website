## Additional IceCube workshops and talks

### Monday September 24 from 12:30-14:30- Women's Event

**Hiring women in physics**

You are planning to apply for a postdoc or a faculty position and are wondering if the hiring committee will assess you in the same way they do your male colleagues. Or maybe you are the one hiring, and you are committed to giving the same opportunities to both women and men. How do these hirings work? What makes a position or a lab more, or less, interesting to a woman? Are there differences in the CVs or interviews of male and female applicants? And are there best practices in hiring that work well and increase the number of female applicants? Our panelists will share their experiences and answer your questions and concerns. Panelists: Olga Botner, Francis Halzen, Marek Kowalski, Dawn Williams

### Tuesday September 25 from 12:30-14:30- Communication Workshop

**Communicating effectively with the media: learning from TXS 0506+056**

A dream comes true: you find yourself writing the paper that proves your research project is successful. You have accomplished what you told your funding agency, your colleagues, and all your friends that you would one day do. Now it’s time to approach the media or prepare for their interviews. What do journalists need from you? What can you do to make them (and us) more successful—i.e., to get the best stories out there? Join us in this new workshop of the IceCube Communications program and be ready to interview and/or be interviewed. Workshop conducted by Sílvia Bravo Gallart.
