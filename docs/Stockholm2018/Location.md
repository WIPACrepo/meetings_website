## Getting around Stockholm

Best way to get around Stockholm is by the [Stockholm Public Transport, SL](https://sl.se/en/) which is responsible for buses, underground trains, commuter trains and more in Greater Stockholm.

Recommendation- buy a SL card which cost 20 SEK and can be purchased at SL Centers, underground ticket booths, newsagent kiosks and at the airport. These can be charged with any sum and validated electronically. Each validation ("ticket") costs 31 SEK and lasts for 75 minutes. Buying single tickets without a SL Access card costs 44 SEK, and is generally more complicated. It'a also possible to buy a 7 day unlimited travel with SL card for 325 SEK. Cash is not accepted to board buses.
