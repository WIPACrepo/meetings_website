# Artscience Event

## Transdisciplinary Collaboration in ArtScience: exploring new worlds, realizing the imagined

[Munich Museum, Center for new Technologies](http://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/exhibitions/new-technologies/)
Wednesday, 09 October at 8pm
This event will delve into the challenges, benefits, and promise of transdisciplinary ArtScience to enhance the exploration and expression of new ideas and phenomena. ArtScience is a methodology whereby researchers from art and science work together as equal collaborators with the results contributing simultaneously to the discourse as an artistic expression while leading to new scientific innovation and understanding.
 
Advances in technology not only fuel new opportunities for scientific exploration such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, they also provide the potential for deeper connections between art and science through a common language of new media. New media can serve as an equalizer for the exchange of knowledge and information, creating a platform for the interchange of ideas.
 
The questions to be explored by the panel and audience include what commonalities exist between the domains of art and science (creativity, curiosity, exploration, research, and investigation); what are the parallel innovations, and how can they be leveraged to enhance both domains; and how collaborative work between art and science can be harnessed to explore new models of innovation and a deeper connection to our changing understanding of the Universe.
