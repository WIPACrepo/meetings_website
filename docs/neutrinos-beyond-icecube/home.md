# Home


## Neutrinos Beyond IceCube, a one-day workshop on possible enhancements to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, will be held on Thursday, April 24, 2014, at the Hilton Arlington in Arlington, Virginia.  

IceCubeâ€™s recent discovery of a flux of high-energy neutrinos from outside the solar system marks a turning point for neutrino astrophysics.

The workshop will:
- Examine possible upgrades to the IceCube observatory designed to explore this high-energy flux,
- Investigate ideas to detect and measure cosmogenic neutrinos at the highest energies, and
- Explore methods to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and measure neutrino oscillation parameters using high statistics of atmospheric neutrino samples obtained with PINGU.

The workshop aims to bring together lead physicists, engineers, and agency representatives to explore potential additions to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole.
