*Advocating for Inclusive Communities and Exploring Systems of Power: A Social Justice Workshop*

What does an inclusive community look like? How can we grow our capacity to create change and advocate for others within our work? This workshop will offer participants the opportunity for a greater understanding of their own positionality and connection to systems of power and privilege by exploring what an inclusive community can look like at work and how individuals can incorporate principles of social justice into their daily practice.

This workshop will be led by Caitlyn LoMonte, the Program Director of Social Education Programs for the Office of Inclusion Education at UW–Madison.
