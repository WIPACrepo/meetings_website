# Virtual Banquet

A virtual banquet will be held Friday, Sept. 25 @11am CDT on Zoom.

Because it’s a virtual banquet, we won’t be serving our typical banquet fare: beef, chicken, or the life-altering vegetarian ravioli. Instead, we’re asking everyone to [submit their favorite recipes here](https://forms.gle/3kDgLJuoZzXDdvYH9).

All the recipes will be compiled into an official ***IceCube Recipe Book and shared ahead of the banquet***.

We hope you will try out someone’s favorite dish and/or drink and let your colleagues know how it turned out in the virtual discussion afterwards!

Zoom information is available in [Indico](https://events.icecube.wisc.edu/event/125/sessions/1903/#20200925).
