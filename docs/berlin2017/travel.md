## Travel to Berlin: 

### By Plane:
There are two nearby airports which are both accessible by public transport system.
[Tegel Airport (TXL)](http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/travellers-txl/index.php) is situated in the northwest of Berlin. It's approximately 8km/5 miles from city centre. This airport is connected by the S-Bahn train lines. More info HERE.
 
[Sch√∂nefeld Airport (SXF)](http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/travellers-sxf/index.php) is situated in the southeast of Berlin. It's approximately 15km/9miles from city centre.  This airport is connected by the S-Bahn train lines. More info [HERE](http://www.s-bahn-berlin.de/en/route-information). Please note - this airport is in fare zone C (outside city limit) and thus not part of the public transport ticket included in the conference.
