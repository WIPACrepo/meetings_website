# Scientific Program


We are pleased to announce that the IceCube Particle Astrophysics Symposium, organized by the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center ([WIPAC](http://wipac.wisc.edu/)), will take place in Madison, Wisconsin, from Monday, May 8 through Wednesday, May 10, 2017.
 
Following the success of the previous IPA symposiums, this event continues the spirit of the historic Telemark meetings on neutrino physics. The topics include: 
- neutrino astronomy, transient astrophysics, and related multiwavelength messengers—cosmic rays, high-energy gamma rays, gravitational waves;
- neutrino properties (including accelerator-based experiments); and
- related cosmological and dark matter aspects of particle astrophysics. 

The format will follow that of the Madison Pheno meetings with morning plenary talks and afternoon parallel sessions.  The meeting’s topics focus on the interplay between theory and experiment in resolving the major open questions in the field of particle astrophysics for the next decade.
 
### Monday, May 8
morning: plenary sessions
afternoon: parallel sessions
evening: banquet
 
### Tuesday, May 9
