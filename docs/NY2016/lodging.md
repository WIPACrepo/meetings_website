# Lodging

 
## Cosmic Ray & Muon workshops in Delaware April 14-17

You will need to book your own room. The hotels within walking (or free campus bus) distance of the physics department:

### Courtyard Marriott:

Courtyard Marriott is run by the University and is the most expensive, probably about $160 per night.

### Embassy Suites:

### Baymont Inn:
Baymont Inn (previously a Sleep Inn) is under a $100 per night and lower if it is booked more than 7 days in advance.  We have had visitors stay there before when it was a Sleep Inn, and reports are that it is still ok but not as luxurious as the other two.
