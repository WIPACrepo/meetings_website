We have been asked whether we could arrange for a picnic/dinner at one of the beaches nearby Stony Brook during the meeting. The answer is yes!
However we need a headcount of people that would like to attend in order to organize the food. So please let us know by adding your name to this form if you would like to join.
 
Date/Time: Wednesday, 20th, 4 to 8pm
Price: $15 per person
Location: West Meadow Beach map | information
 
Menu:
Hamburgers
Jerk Chicken Thighs,
Adobo Chicken Thighs
Peppers and Onions on Rice
Non-alcoholic beverages will be provided, since the consumption of alcoholic beverages is not allowed (risk of being ticketed). Restrooms are available on site.
Please be aware that the weather in mid-April has large variance and is pretty much unpredictable. The gazebo is reserved but if the weather is too bad we will have to move the event to the basement of the Physics Deptment on campus.
