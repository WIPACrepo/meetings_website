Google maps are always very helpful to locate your destination. It is kept well up-to-date. (You may need a backup battery considering the use of GPS drains the battery very quickly unless you have the newest smartphones.)</li> <li>Some restaurants do not carry their menu in English.  In that case, Google Translate installed on your phone is very helpful. It has a nice feature where you can take a picture of text, it will identify the characters and translate to your language of choice (quality can vary). You won\u2019t need any Japanese reader explaining you what is in the menu!</li> <li>If you buy something at a store, they will most likely put your purchases in a plastic bag fairly quickly without asking you. If you don\u2019t want one, pay attention and mention it quickly. The Earth will thank you. You can say \u201cFukuro Irimasen\u201d to say no to the bag.</li> <li>IC cards, like the ones called Suica, may be useful during your stay. For instance, you can buy the Suica card at a ticket vending machine at the JR station. You can use the card to pay the fee of the train or bus and to pay at some stores, and Chiba Univ. cafeteria accepts the Suica card as well. To purchase the card, you need to pay the deposit of 500 yen and charge the amount of money you wish. When you return the card to \u201cMidori no Madoguchi\u201d ticket office at a rather large JR station, they will refund the money charged in your card including your deposit with the handling fee of 220 yen. For more details on how to use the card, please refer: https://www.thejapanguy.com/using-your-suica-card-and-pasmo-card/</li> <li>You will see several convenient stores all over the town in Chiba/Tokyo. The stores are opened for 24 hours a day, and it is a good place to go if you need to get some take-out or snacks to eat. People here call them, Convini; the main ones are Family Mart (Famima), Lawson, Seven-Eleven(Seven), and Mini-Stop. Here is some useful Japanese phrases when you shop at the Convini.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"chiba2019/tips/#things-you-are-likely-asked-at-the-convini","title":"Things you are likely asked at the Convini:","text":"<ul> <li>Fukuro wa Irimasuka? \u2013 Do you want a bag?</li> <li>Obento o Atatame Masuka? \u2013 May I warm your take-out (meal)?</li> <li>Pointo kaado wa Arimasuka? \u2013 Do you have a point card?</li> <li>Reshiito wa Irimasuka? \u2013 Do you need your receipt?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"chiba2019/tips/#the-ways-you-respond","title":"The ways you respond:","text":"<ul> <li>Hai - Yes</li> <li>IIe - No</li> <li>Wakarimasen \u2013 I have no idea what you are saying.</li> <li>Daijobu \u2013 No problem or I am OK without it (a plastic bag or receipt).</li> <li>Fukuro Irimasen - I don\u2019t need a bag.</li> <li>Atatame Onegaishimasu - Will you warm it up for me?</li> </ul> <p>If you are a vegetarian, it is sometimes hard to find restaurants which carry the vegetarian-friendly menus, but you can always ask them to suggest you the menu which doesn\u2019t contain non-vegetarian products. The cards below may help you to communicate with them easier. What you may want to watch out is Dashi, the stock. For instance, you can find many varieties of tofu menu at the restaurants in Japan, but the dashi soup or sauce served with the tofu may be made from fish or meat.</p> <p> </p> <p>You don\u2019t leave any tip at restaurants as this is not a custom in Japan.  However, it will still be wise to carry some cash since some stores and restaurants don\u2019t accept credit card payment. You can easily find ATM which you can use with your international bank card. They usually have the button to change the information shown in English. https://www.sevenbank.co.jp/intlcard/service2.html</p> <p>When you are at a restaurant, you may want to call waiters if you want to be helped. After you made an order, they don\u2019t come to check on you to see if you need help in the same manner the waiters do in the US. Some restaurants leave a button on each table for customers to push when they need help. Other restaurants may expect you to call them by saying \u201cSumimasen\u201d (Excuse me).  Making payment at the table is getting more and more familiar in Japan, but you can also go to their check desk.</p>"},{"location":"chiba2019/tour-hamamatsu-photonics/","title":"Tour Hamamatsu Photonics","text":""},{"location":"chiba2019/tour-hamamatsu-photonics/#tour-of-hamamatsu-photonics","title":"Tour of Hamamatsu Photonics","text":"<p>50 seats available on the chartered bus from Hamamatsu Station to Toyooka factory of Hamamatsu Photonics.</p> <p>Hamamatsu cannot accommodate more than 50 guests on this tour.

New media can serve as an equalizer for the exchange of knowledge and information, creating a platform for the interchange of ideas.</p> <p>The questions to be explored by the panel and audience include what commonalities exist between the domains of art and science (creativity, curiosity, exploration, research, and investigation); what are the parallel innovations, and how can they be leveraged to enhance both domains; and how collaborative work between art and science can be harnessed to explore new models of innovation and a deeper connection to our changing understanding of the Universe.</p>"},{"location":"munich2013/artscience/#confirmed-panel-members","title":"Confirmed Panel Members:","text":"<p>Rachel Armstrong Sustainability Innovator, Co-Director of AVATAR (Advanced Virtual and Technological Architectural Research) in Architecture &amp; Synthetic Biology at The School of Architecture &amp; Construction, University of Greenwich, London</p> <p>Francis Halzen IceCube Principal Investigator, Hilldale and Gregory Breit Professor at the University Wisconsin-Madison</p> <p>Mark-David Hosale New Media Artist and Composer, Assistant Professor in Digital Media at York University, Toronto, Canada</p> <p>Karsten Klein Deutsches Museum, Munich, Germany</p> <p>Jane Prophet New Media Artist, Professor of Art and Interdisciplinary Computing at Goldsmiths, London</p> <p>Ed Shanken Contemporary and New Media Art Historian, The Center for Digital Art and Experimental Media (DXARTS), University of Washington</p> <p>Christian Spiering DESY Zeuthen</p>"},{"location":"munich2013/banquet/","title":"Banquet","text":""},{"location":"munich2013/banquet/#banquet-welcome-party","title":"Banquet &amp; Welcome Party","text":"<p>The banquet will be held on Thursday October 10th at Hofbr\u00e4ukeller, located at Innere Wiener Stra\u00dfe 19.

But if you just imagine you were booking a hotel in Paris rather than in Bielefeld, you may end up being pleasantly surprised by what you get.</li> <li>It gets terribly expensive during fairs and exhibitions and by terribly expensive I mean terribly expensive and there will be a big fair during the collaboration meeting. Expect to end up paying several hundreds of Euros per night for a simple hotel if you book too late. So, go book your hotel now! Check the details for cancellations and you should be fine to secure rooms for every member of your group that might go to the meeting.</li> <li>Most of the more affordable hotels are around the train station. It\u2019s not the nicest area of Mu\u0308nchen, and you will occasionally see complaints about that in hotel reviews. But: it is ok, I have stayed there many times and it has never been a problem to get to my hotel. Just don\u2019t expect to find great food around there (but then I am super-picky) and don\u2019t necessarily plan on hanging out on the street between the dubious nightclubs after dark (but it\u2019s ok to walk to your hotel) and you will appreciate to be quite centrally situated.</li> <li>Be careful when choosing your hotel if you cannot live without wifi; hotels in Mu\u0308nchen are a bit behind the rest of the world and it is often expensive or not even possible to have an internet connection in your room.</li> <li>Choose a central location or try to be close to the U2. Near the meeting place is good, near the train station is ok, Schwabing is good and near Marienplatz is also good. Areas are Maxvorstadt (that\u2019s where the university is), Ludwigsvorstadt (that\u2019s where the train station is), Schwabing and Altstadt-Lehel (Marienplatz etc). I would try not go further away from the center.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"munich2013/lodging/#personal-reviews","title":"Personal Reviews","text":"<p>Reviews by Sirin Odrowski</p> <p>All impressions are personal and there is no guarantee that my taste is in any way similar to yours. Prices are for the period of the meeting; most of these hotels were actually cheaper when I stayed there. Most of these hotels have only few rooms for the time of the meeting, so try to be fast if you want one of them. Some of these hotels do not show any availability during the meeting at the moment. They might be blocked for the fair, so it might worth to check again later if you didn\u2019t make your booking now \u2013 but you should book now!!!</p>"},{"location":"munich2013/lodging/#hotel-achterbahn","title":"Hotel Achterbahn","text":"<p>between around 50 (four person per room) and 90 (single room) Euros per night and person A small and somehow stylish but simple hotel. It is very close to an U-Bahn station and not far from the train station (but already outside the nightclub etc district). It should be no big deal to get to the meeting or to any other central place in Mu\u0308nchen from there. Very clean and quiet room, modern bathroom and the people there are very nice. The description says that wifi is available in public areas but that refers to the cafe attached to the hotel, i.e. there is no wifi when the cafe is closed. The beds are bit hard but I would still stay there again just for the breakfast. For only 5 Euros extra, you\u2019ll get a breakfast at their cafe, including juice and coffee (not only filtered coffee but something real). You\u2019ll have a choice between different options (also Weisswurst if you like them), and the omelette with feta cheese is really good. However, breakfast is made to order and the cafe opens at 8, so you might have to make a compromise between breakfast and the first talks of the meeting.</p>"},{"location":"munich2013/lodging/#hotel-amenity-arirang","title":"Hotel Amenity-Arirang","text":"<p>The room was the largest I had so far in Mu\u0308nchen and it was clean and nice. The staff are friendly but it\u2019s not very centrally located and you should only use it if do not find anything else (and that\u2019s why I was there too). There are only few options for food around, and I don\u2019t recommend the small place next door (the people at the hotel do recommend it) where they will look at you as if you were an alien and the food is also not very nice. For some reason, there are some reviews of this hotel which claim they had a Korean breakfast buffet but to me it looked pretty much like a standard German breakfast buffet (but of course I have never been to Korea, so who knows, they might just have German breakfast there). Good internet connection and within walking distance of an U-Bahn station.</p>"},{"location":"munich2013/lodging/#hotel-blue","title":"Hotel Blue","text":"<p>The single rooms are quite small (and blue).

I paid less than half of the price when I was there and I would say it was ok for that price. I had a good internet connection and the room was clean and everything. The hotels have their own design scheme (a lot of orange and green and a cow, see below), being supposedly very comfortable and are aimed at younger people. I didn\u2019t try the breakfast. One thing to note is that rooms should only be shared with reasonably good friends \u2013 the shower is integrated into the room and the view into the shower is only partially obscured by a big cow-eating-grass print on the glass around the shower.</p>"},{"location":"munich2013/lodging/#hotel-dolomit","title":"Hotel Dolomit","text":"<p>(around 130 Euros/night in a double room) Very close to the train station, slightly noisy from the street but the room was fine.

Don\u2019t try to walk from the train station, I did and it\u2019s too far for a pleasant walk. There is another branch more in the center, you might want to check out that one. Don\u2019t go to the one in Garching, that\u2019s too far outside! The room was nice, I liked the design, the internet connection was fast and it\u2019s all new and shiny.

A solid choice but nothing special. The breakfast was ok but not exciting and the room was clean and not as small as others. I hated that the illumination of the facade was shining into my room at night and kept changing its color all the time, so I could not sleep until they switched it off quite late in the night. Apart from that nothing to complain about. Close to a good but slightly expensive vegan restaurant (and they don\u2019t even sell alcohol in that restaurant!).

Most of these places are not registered in web sites like booking.com, so they might still have rooms when everything else is booked out.

It\u2019s within easy walking distance of Mu\u0308nchener Freiheit and there are also a lot of restaurants and shops around. Most of the rooms have shared bathrooms (which are very clean and it\u2019s a small place so you don\u2019t share with a lot of people), and since it is run by an old-lady, its interior design is a bit old-fashioned. Breakfast is served in the room. Wifi is working without problems. I would stay there again, and it\u2019s cheap compared to hotels. For reservations it\u2019s better to call since they don\u2019t seem to check their mails too often. I guess the old lady doesn\u2019t speak English but her son and daughter-in-law might.

Seventy years later the term is commonly understood to  be a social construct and used to describe and discuss the social roles of  men and women, including inequalities between both groups. Governments and  organizations all over the world are taking measures to counter such gender  inequalities, which can range from an imbalance between the amount of men  and women working in certain fields (e.g. STEM) to discrimination against  one of the two groups. At RWTH Aachen University, the rectorate staff unit Integration Team \u2013 Human Resources, Gender and Diversity Management (IGaD)  has established several programs and activities to promote gender equality  as well as diversity and inclusivity. One of them is to advise applicants  when writing research proposals on the use of gender-sensitive language and  to help conceptualize project-specific equal opportunities measures, the new  standard in funding requirements. Thus, gender awareness has become  ignificant also in science communication: scientists, politicians,  journalists and the public talk / write about inequalities in all types of  media.
